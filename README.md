[@ This bot isn’t some token grabber or shady crap. Fuck off skids who use that shit and think they’re "black hat hackers." This bot was made with heart and is fully open source — check the code, use it for your own bots if you need. I don’t tolerate skids or copycats putting shit in their GitHub repos. So I made mine to be sure it’s safe — for me, and for people who need safe things without being paranoid, and checking their task manager and PID tasks. @]

[@| Requested by the owner for his server. I built it for free, but if you need a custom bot, hit me up on Discord. I’m here to help for free. |@]
